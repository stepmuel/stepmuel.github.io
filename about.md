My name is Stephan Müller and I got my master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from ETH Zürich in 2015. For my master's thesis, I created the [HeapCraft](http://heapcraft.net/) project and published a bunch of conference papers. 

You can contact me at stephan<span class="nospam">@</span>heap.ch or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/stepmuel). If you enjoy my blog posts and want to keep them coming, or one of my coding projects saved you hours of work, please consider showing your appreciation by a [donation](https://www.paypal.me/heap).
