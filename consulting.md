I write iOS apps since 2013 and have been writing web based administration tools and services for over 10 years. I created several Minecraft plugins and a telemetry system to collect data for scientific research. If you need an iOS app (iPhone, iPad, Apple TV), a Web app, a Minecraft plugin, or something else that fits my profile, send me an email: stephan<span class="nospam">@</span>heap.ch
