I write iOS apps since 2013 and have been creating web based administration tools and services <!-- since before 2005 --> for over 15 years. I have experience working in both industry and scientific research. <!-- If you need an iOS app (iPhone, iPad, Apple TV), a web app, a Minecraft plugin, or something else that fits my profile, send me an email: stephan<span class="nospam">@</span>heap.ch -->

I am not accepting any new freelance work at this time.
